Simplified Android Market Client
================================

market.py defines the Market class.

Market accepts an authentication token and Android device ID in its constructor
to continue an existing session.  If your session expires, you should use the login()
method to obtain a new authentication token (which will be set in self.auth_token after
a successful login).

The Market object exposes a single function, get_app_info, that accepts an application
name and returns the App information along with the download URL and authorized cookies
that must accompany the download request.

Protocol Buffers bindings (and market.proto) are from the http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/ project.
